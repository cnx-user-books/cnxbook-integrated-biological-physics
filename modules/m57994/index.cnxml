<para id="fs-id1754472">Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it has some unique properties of its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical potential at a fixed rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction mechanism. This property is known as <term>autorhythmicity</term>. Neither smooth nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though cardiac muscle has autorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by the endocrine and nervous systems.</para><section id="fs-id1559809"><title>Structure of Cardiac Muscle</title><para id="fs-id2868561">Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably shorter with much smaller diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern of dark A bands and light I bands attributed to the precise arrangement of the myofilaments and fibrils that are organized in sarcomeres along the length of the cell (<link target-id="fig-ch20_02_01" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>). These contractile elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle. T (transverse) tubules penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to reach the interior. The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of the A and I bands. Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle. In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from outside the cells. The result is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are plentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart. Typically, cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id2059765">Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an <term>intercalated disc</term>, which helps support the synchronized contraction of the muscle (<link target-id="fig-ch20_02_01" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>). The importance of strongly binding these cells together is necessitated by the forces exerted by contraction.</para><figure id="fig-ch20_02_01"><title>Cardiac Muscle </title><media id="fs-id2179569" alt="The top left panel of this figure shows the cross structure of cardiac muscle with the major parts labeled.

<para id="fs-id2473933"><title>Repair and Replacement</title>Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced.</para></note>

<title>Conduction System of the Heart</title>
<para id="fs-id1918000">If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its own electrical impulse followed by contraction. When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together, the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a contraction. As more cells are joined together, the fastest cell continues to assume control of the rate. A fully developed adult heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse, triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac conduction system. The components of the cardiac conduction system include the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the atrioventricular bundle, the atrioventricular bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers (<link target-id="fig-ch20_02_02" document=""/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch20_02_02"><title>Conduction System of the Heart </title><media id="fs-id2318309" alt="This image shows the anterior view of the frontal section of the heart with the major parts labeled.">

<caption>Specialized conducting components of the heart include the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the atrioventricular bundle, the right and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers.</caption></figure><section id="fs-id1547155">
<title>Sinoatrial (SA) Node</title>
<para id="fs-id3089583">Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the <term>sinoatrial (SA) node</term>, a specialized clump of myocardial conducting cells located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the opening of the superior vena cava. The SA node is known as the <term>pacemaker</term> of the heart. It initiates the <term>sinus rhythm</term>, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.</para><para id="fs-id1535485">This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes.  The connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node. <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_03" document=""/> illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.</para><figure id="fig-ch20_02_03"><title>Cardiac Conduction </title><media id="fs-id1520230" alt="This image shows the different stages in the conduction cycle of the heart.">

<caption>(1) The sinoatrial (SA) node and the remainder of the conduction system are at rest. (2) The SA node initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria. (3) After reaching the atrioventricular node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle. (4) Following the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers. (5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular contraction begins.</caption></figure></section>

<title>Atrioventricular (AV) Node</title>
<para id="fs-id1729268">The <term>atrioventricular (AV) node</term> is a second clump of specialized conductive cells, located in the lower portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular wall. There is a critical pause before the AV node initiates an impulse and transmits it to the atrioventricular bundle (see <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_03" document=""/>, step 3). </para></section>
<section id="fs-id1518716">
<title>Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers</title>
<para id="fs-id1273399">Arising from the AV node, the <term>atrioventricular bundle</term>, proceeds through the septum before dividing into two <term>atrioventricular bundle branches</term>, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_03" document=""/>, step 4).</para><para id="fs-id2533079">The <term>Purkinje fibers</term> are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk.</para></section>

<title>Electrocardiogram</title>
<para id="fs-id1619546">By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound electrical signal of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the <term>electrocardiogram (ECG)</term>, also commonly abbreviated EKG (K coming kardiology, from the German term for cardiology). Careful analysis of the ECG reveals a detailed picture of both normal and abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool. The standard electrocardiograph (the instrument that generates an ECG) uses 3, 5, or 12 leads. The greater the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more information the ECG provides. The term âleadâ may be used to refer to the cable from the electrode to the electrical recorder, but it typically describes the voltage difference between two of the electrodes. The 12-lead electrocardiograph uses 10 electrodes placed in standard locations on the patientâs skin (<link target-id="fig-ch20_02_06" document=""/>). In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs, the patient wears a small, portable, battery-operated device known as a Holter monitor, that continuously monitors heart electrical activity, typically for a period of 24 hours during the patientâs normal routine.</para><figure id="fig-ch20_02_06"><title>Standard Placement of ECG Leads </title><media id="fs-id1626809" alt="This diagram shows the points where electrodes are placed on the body for an ECG.">

Each component, segment, and interval is labeled and corresponds to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the heart.</para>
<para id="fs-id2458514">There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. The small <term>P wave</term> represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting approximately 25 ms after the start of the P wave. The large <term>QRS complex</term> represents the depolarization of the ventricles, which requires a much stronger electrical signal because of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R wave. Lastly, the <term>T wave</term> represents the repolarization of the ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the QRS complex, which masks it on an ECG.</para>

<title>Everyday Connection</title>
<para id="fs-id1293915">While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of the electrical variations, the duration of the events, and detailed analysis provide the most comprehensive picture of cardiac function. For example, an amplified P wave may indicate enlargement of the atria and an enlarged Q wave may indicate a MI (Myocardial Infarction). T waves often appear flatter when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium. </para><para id="fs-id1527865">As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all areas suffering a MI may be obvious on the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the pumping, which requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown in <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_09" document=""/>.</para><figure id="fig-ch20_02_09"><title>Common ECG Abnormalities </title><media id="fs-id1499742" alt="In this image the QT cycle for different heart conditions are shown.

<para id="fs-id2011302"><title>External Automated Defibrillators</title>
In the event that the electrical activity of the heart is severely disrupted, cessation of electrical activity or fibrillation may occur. In fibrillation, the heart beats in a wild, uncontrolled manner, which prevents it from being able to pump effectively. Atrial fibrillation (see <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_09" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>) is a serious condition, but as long as the ventricles continue to pump blood, the patientâs life may not be in immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see <link target-id="fig-ch20_02_09" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">d</emphasis>) is a medical emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital setting, it is often described as âcode blue.â If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to brain death. The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (<link target-id="fig-ch20_02_10" document=""/>). A defibrillator effectively stops the heart so that the SA node can trigger a normal conduction cycle. Because of their effectiveness in reestablishing a normal sinus rhythm, external automated defibrillators (EADs) are being placed in areas frequented by large numbers of people, such as schools, restaurants, and airports. These devices contain simple and direct verbal instructions that can be followed by nonmedical personnel in an attempt to save a life.</para>

<para id="fs-id1499991">When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in the AV node. In order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an <term>artificial pacemaker</term>, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart continues to contract and pump blood effectively. These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis. Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators.</para>

<para id="fs-id1037269">The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine (i.e. hormonal) control, yet it is capable of initiating its own action potential followed by muscular contraction. The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart rate and transmit it through the myocardium. The contractile cells contract and propel the blood. The normal path of transmission for the conductive cells is the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization (i.e. contraction), the QRS complex that corresponds to ventricular depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular repolarization (relaxation).</para></section>
